PVS-CORE
========

Startups often start out reinventing the wheel.  Off the shelf solutions are insufficient for their needs and, while providing quick benefits
for time to market, they lack the ability to be customized to taste.  In the end, the product may suffer or at least hinder the development
of the real mission of the startup.

PVS-CORE attempts to make it easy to launch a startup and get your idea off the ground quickly, yet provides solid and capable groundwork
that will not need replacing as the venture grows.

Businesses need to relate to customers for sales and contacts, show their content/product, and develop their product quickly. PVS-CORE fills these needs
because it is simultaneously a Customer Relationship Management system (CRM), light Content Mangement System (CMS), and a starting point
for constructing almost any kind of web application.  It builds upon the Pyramid web framework, a widely used, open source framework for building 
websites, and Sqlalchemy, the best-of-breed ORM layer for Python.

* Flexible *
Plug in framework allows for simple integration into the CRM UI.  Create batch jobs that integrate directly with the CRM and your own business logic.

* Powerful *
Host multiple websites and companies on the same framework and on the same server.  Segment customers using any of 12 dimensions.  Create different pricing
structures by customer segment.  Create custom reports directly in the UI with SQL templates.

* Robust *
Run multiple servers behind non-sticky load balancing for high availability.  Combine with Postgres replication to create a rock solid platform for your business.
