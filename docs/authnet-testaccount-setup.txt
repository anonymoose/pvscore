Dear Ken Bedwell:

Thank you for signing up for an Authorize.Net developer test account. Please review this e-mail in its entirety as it contains important information.

Your test account is active and ready for you to begin testing now. Simply visit https://developer.authorize.net/integration/fifteenminutes to download the appropriate SDK and test your connection in fifteen minutes or less.

To access your test account using the Merchant Interface, go to https://sandbox.authorize.net and log in using the Login ID and Password you created when requesting your test account. If you forgot your Login ID or Password, you can use the links located on the login page to request that information.

If you need your test account's API Login ID and Transaction Key, simply log in to the Merchant Interface and click "Account." Then click "API Login ID and Transaction Key." Your API Login ID will be displayed. For security reasons, you cannot view your Transaction Key. Instead, you must generate a new one. To do this you will need the Secret Answer to the system-generated Secret Question, which is "Simon".

You can check out our Developer Center at http://developer.authorize.net for sample code, SDKs, integration guides, troubleshooting tools and more. You can also visit our Developer Community at http://community.developer.authorize.net to share tips and best practices with other developers like you.
