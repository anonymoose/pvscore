# How to get a godaddy SSL cert to work.
#
0. Create keys on the server where the cert will live.
    openssl genrsa -out www.xyz.com.key 2048
    openssl req -new -key www.xyz.com.key -out www.xyz.com.csr
        You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
        into your certificate request.
        What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
        There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
        For some fields there will be a default value,
        If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
        -----
        Country Name (2 letter code) [XX]:US
        State or Province Name (full name) []:California
        Locality Name (eg, city) [Default City]:Redlands
        Organization Name (eg, company) [Default Company Ltd]:Wealthmakers
        Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:IT
        Common Name (eg, your name or your server's hostname) []:www.xyz.com
        Email Address []:kenneth.bedwell@gmail.com
    # you end up with www.xyz.com.key and www.xyz.com.csr

1. Buy it.
2. Go through the approval process.
3. Download it.  You get a zip file xyz.com.zip with 2 files:  xyz.com.crt gd_bundle.crt
4. Pound needs a PEM file, which is a correctly ordered bunch of keys.
   cat www.xyz.com.key xyz.com.crt gd_bundle.crt > xyz.com.pem
5. put PEM file in a place that matches the Cert directive in the Pound
   configuration file.
6. bounce and test
